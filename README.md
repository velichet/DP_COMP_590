# DP_COMP_590
As part of our COMP 590 project, we will implement differential privacy for datasets.

It's recommended to run the app in a virtual environment. Below are the steps to do that.
```
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./<name_of_virtualenv>

# Activate the virtual environment
source <name_of_virtualenv>/bin/activate 

# Use pip or pip3 to install dependences
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start running the app use the following command. It should run on localhost port 8000.
```
# Start the app
python app.py
```
